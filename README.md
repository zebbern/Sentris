# ShipSec Studio

**Open-Source Security Workflow Orchestration Platform.**

> ShipSec is currently in active development. We are optimizing the platform for stable production use and high-performance security operations.

ShipSec Studio provides a visual DSL and runtime for building, executing, and monitoring automated security workflows. It decouples security logic from infrastructure management, providing a durable and isolated environment for running security tooling at scale.

### 🏗️ Core Pillars

- **Durable, resumable workflows** powered by Temporal.io for stateful execution across failures.
- **Isolated security runtimes** using ephemeral containers with per-run volume management.
- **Unified telemetry streams** delivering terminal output, events, and logs via a low-latency SSE pipeline.
- **Visual no-code builder** that compiles complex security graphs into an executable DSL.

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. Shipsec Self-Host with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run ShipSec Studio on your own infrastructure:

#### One-Line Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.shipsec.ai | bash
```

This installer will:

- Check and install missing dependencies (docker, just, curl, jq, git)
- Start Docker if not running
- Clone the repository and start all services
- Guide you through any required setup steps

Once complete, visit **http://localhost** to access ShipSec Studio.

### 2. ShipSec Cloud (Preview)

The fastest way to test ShipSec Studio without managing infrastructure.

- **Try it out:** [studio.shipsec.ai](https://studio.shipsec.ai)
- **Note:** ShipSec Studio is under active development. The cloud environment is a technical preview for evaluation and sandbox testing.

### 3. Self-Host (Docker)

For teams requiring data residency and air-gapped security orchestrations. This setup runs the full stack (Frontend, Backend, Worker, and Infrastructure).

**Prerequisites:**

- **[docker](https://www.docker.com/)** - For running the application and security components
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** - Command runner for simplified workflows
- **curl** and **jq** - For fetching release information

```bash
# Clone and start the latest stable release
git clone https://github.com/ShipSecAI/studio.git
cd studio
just prod start-latest
```

Access the studio at `http://localhost`.

- **Discovery**: `Subfinder`, `DNSX`, `Naabu`, `HTTPx`
- **Vulnerability**: `Nuclei`, `TruffleHog`
- **Utility**: `JSON Transform`, `Logic Scripts`, `HTTP Requests`

### Advanced Orchestration

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause workflows for approvals, form inputs, or manual validation before continuing.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Leverage LLM nodes and MCP providers for intelligent results interpretation.
- **Native Scheduling**: Integrated CRON support for recurring security posture and compliance monitoring.
- **API First**: Trigger and monitor any workflow execution via a comprehensive REST API.

### MCP Integration

- **MCP Library**: Centralized MCP server management with multi-server selection and automatic tool registration
- **Built-in MCP Servers**: AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Filesystem support out-of-the-box
- **Seamless Tool Discovery**: AI Agents automatically discover and use MCP tools via standardized contracts

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

ShipSec Studio is designed for enterprise-grade durability and horizontal scalability.

- **Management Plane (Backend)**: NestJS service handling DSL compilation, secret management (AES-256-GCM), and identity.
- **Orchestration Plane (Temporal)**: Manages workflow state, concurrency, and persistent wait states.
- **Execution Plane (Worker)**: Stateless agents that pull tasks from Temporal and execute tool-bound activities in isolated runtimes.
- **Monitoring (SSE/Loki)**: Real-time telemetry pipeline for deterministic execution visibility.

Learn more about our design decisions and system components in the **[Architecture Deep-dive](/docs/architecture.mdx)**.

## 🔀 Multi-Instance Development

Run multiple isolated dev instances on one machine for parallel feature work:

```bash
# Instance 0 (default)
just dev

# Switch active workspace instance
just instance use 1
just dev

# Manage per-instance env files
just instance-env init 1
```

Each instance gets its own frontend port, backend port, database, and Temporal namespace while sharing a single Docker infra stack. See [Multi-Instance Development Guide](docs/MULTI-INSTANCE-DEV.md) for full details.
